&nbsp;

Independent Component Analysis with Python for Cognitive Science students.

### Theoretical background

Two articles introducing mathematical concept behind ICA:
 1. [Independent Component Analysis - ICA - In Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/independent-component-analysis-ica-in-python-a0ef0db0955e)
 2. [Separating mixed signals with Independent Component Analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/separating-mixed-signals-with-independent-component-analysis-38205188f2f4)

 We will focus on the second article. There is an accompanying IPython Notebook for it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/akcarsten/Independent_Component_Analysis).

 You can download the entire repository with:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/akcarsten/Independent_Component_Analysis
 ```

### Removing artifacts from EEG signal

Now we will analyze artifact detection and correction in EEG data with Python-MNE. An example for that is available in Documentation [here](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/preprocessing/plot_40_artifact_correction_ica.html) and as IPython Notebook [here](https://mne.tools/stable/_downloads/8f7e6dfc30a66795f2d4e4ae5ca6d23e/plot_40_artifact_correction_ica.ipynb).

### Visualizing components of fMRI data

fMRI data ICA with nilearn as presented [here](https://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_canica_resting_state.html). Download Jupyter Notebook under [this](https://nilearn.github.io/_downloads/29bdd1aea8bedf18a8ea178b73260c8a/plot_canica_resting_state.ipynb) link.
